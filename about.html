            I am a proud member of the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quapaw">O-Gah-Pah</a> nation and live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States">Midwestern</a> United States. I love my smokin' hot <a href="shrine_wife">wife</a>, three cats, and the Internet (in that order). I am a lifelong computer whiz in both my personal and professional life, and I am very passionate about a return to the ethos of the "old" web of my youth. My main hobbies are <a href="tech.html">tinkering</a> with computers, creating <a href="art.html">art</a> in many forms, and spending time in the beautiful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240127204336/https://www.worldatlas.com/mountains/ozark-mountains.html">Ozark Mountains</a>. I also like to collect things, especially old electronics and physical media. I self-host and maintain numerous archives on my personal server, and I occasionally write articles about technology and Internet history.

            I have a whole lot of other interests that won't fit snugly in a paragraph, so if you want to know more about me and my interests you should <b>click the buttons</b> below! Thank you for taking the time to read this far. I love making websites and creating communal spaces online. I'm not really a manifesto kinda guy, so I'll leave you with a little wisdom: organizing and creating community with others is far more valuable than any material object in both the digital and physical realms. The Internet was not meant to be this way and neither is the real world. It will take all of us to push back, make change, and create a new world that works for everybody. Cheers. :)
