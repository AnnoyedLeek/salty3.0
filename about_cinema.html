            <p>
              I love to read IMDB and Wikipedia while I'm watching a movie so I can spout useless trivia about it later. I also keep a detailed spreadsheet of every movie my wife and I have ever watched together (seriously) and what we rated each one out of 5 stars. I have more "favorite movies" than this, but these ones were the first to come to mind.

                <h2 class="center-text">üíä AKIRA üíä</h2>
                <p>
                  <b>Director:</b> Katsuhiro Otomo
                  <br>
                  <b>Release Year:</b> 1988
                  <br>
                  <b>Genre(s):</b> Science Fiction, Cyberpunk, Anime 
                  <br>
                  <b>Salty Says:</b> This movie is a masterclass in every possible facet of filmmaking. The story is brilliant, the atmosphere is absolutely haunting, the soundtrack and effects could not be more fitting, and the animation is about as close as humanity will get to perfection. <b style="color: var(--slugblue)"><i>Go watch this; feel something.</b></i> Additionally, if you are a native English speaker, I would highly recommend watching the English dub of this movie. It far outweighs the original Japanese audio for me personally, mainly because my brain just doesn't pick up on the nuances of how Japanese speakers convey various emotions.

                <h2 class="center-text">‚òï AMELIE ‚òï</h2>
                <p>
                  <b>Director:</b> Jean-Pierre Jeunet
                  <br>
                  <b>Release Year:</b> 2001
                  <br>
                  <b>Genre(s):</b> Romantic Comedy, Surrealist
                  <br>
                  <b>Salty Says:</b> If you thought Wes Andersen was whimsical then think again! Am√©lie takes the cake on the whole <i>"whimsy and childlike wonder"</i> thing. This movie is an absolute delight. It's heartwarming, charming, and just grounded enough to feel real despite its many surreal elements. Unlike Akira, I would recommend watching this film with its original French audio dub. Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a wonderful filmmaker, and I would also recommend his other movies from this era: "Delicatessen" and "The City of Lost Children."

                  <b>Director:</b> Quentin Tarantino
                  <br>
                  <b>Release Year:</b> 2007
                  <br>
                  <b>Genre(s):</b> Slasher, Thriller
                  <br>
                  <b>Salty Says:</b> The general critical consensus is that this is one of Tarantino's worst films, but <b style="color: var(--slugblue)">I wholeheartedly disagree.</b> This movie is an excellent rework of the 1960s/70s "sexploitation" trope, is a near-perfect homage to all the iconic car chases in cinema history, and is blaringly action-packed from start to finish. Kurt Russell absolutely steals the show with his performance, as does the excellent soundtrack. This is the ultimate <b>girl power</b> movie.

                <b>Director:</b> Edgar Wright
                <br>
                <b>Release Year:</b> 2007
                <br>
                <b>Genre(s):</b> Comedy, Action, Satire
                <br>
                <b>Salty Says:</b> This has been one of my favorite movies since it released, and I've seen it probably 100 times at this point. There is something so inherently charming about everything Simon Pegg and Nick Frost do. They have such great on-screen chemistry, and damn if this movie isn't fucking hilarious. I love the repeated bits and shots that Edgar Wright uses throughout the Cornetta Trilogy; this film is definitely the best out of the three.
