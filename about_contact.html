            In case you couldn't already tell, I love to ramble about most topics. If you want to talk mutual interest, old web stuff, web development, ideology, whatever... I would love to chat! I am also open to art trades and collaborative digital work. Just toss me an email and I will get back to you ASAP.

            Click the bug above to see my profile on <b>Cohost</b>. It's a relatively small Tumblr-like community that is mainly used by "indie web" dwellers and developers. I prefer it to Mastodon and Fediverse communities because, in my opinion, Cohost has far more diverse communities and content. The <a href="https://antisoftware.club/">development company</a> that runs it seems pretty cool, too.

            The <b>MelonLand</b> forum is probably my favorite community spot on the Web right now. There are so many cool discussions and interesting things going on at all hours of the day (except for Mondays). <a href="https://melonking.net">Melon</a> does a wonderful job of running it and the members are all so kind and open-minded.

          <p>I love <b>Status.Cafe</b>; it's such a little cute idea. It's like if a queer kid made Twitter and decided against using it to become a technocratic overlord... but really, I love this concept and also how much freedom there is to customize your page. You can even embed a little (also customizable!!) status widget within a webpage! Click the <b>big coffee lady</b> above to navigate to my site profile.</p>
