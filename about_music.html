            <p>
              I cannot convey to y'all how hard it was to dial this down to 10 bands for length's sake... I ingest an unhealthy amount of music every year. Anyhow, I've given you a little blurb about each artist as well as my favorite album they released. I also listed my three favorite songs <i>(including linked music videos or live performances)</i> from each if you want to listen!
