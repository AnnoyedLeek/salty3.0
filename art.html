              <b>I love making art.</b> I think it's really important for us, as humans, to create art even if we don't perceive it as "good" or technically impressive. I mean, c'mon, we've been doodling on rocks for millenia. It's always been inside us, so you gotta let it out any way you can.

            <h3><a href="art_html_collage.html">HTML Collages</a></h3>
            <p>
              I like to make <b>webpage collages</b> using almost-pure HTML. I only use absolute positioning and very little in-line styling. I code them in VSCodium and get the static images and .gifs from my personal archives. These are definitely my favorite thing to make.

            <h3><a href="art_collage.html">Analog & Digital Collages</a></h3>
            <p>
              I enjoy making <b>digital & analog collages</b> using images mostly from my wife and I's collection of vintage magazines, whose topics vary widely. Most of our collection is '60s/'70s Playboys as well as late '90s-00s video game publications.

              <b>"Esoteric Old Web Art"</b> that I've made using no modern software or tools. No Photoshop, no gimmicky bullshit. I scour for old games, shareware, and the like that allow you to create and save artwork from within them. Aesthetically, think "Kidpix on psychedelics" with a few caveats.

            <p>
              Making <b>3D models and scenes</b> is a relatively new hobby for me. I haven't done too many projects because they are extremely time consuming and make my office hot, but I absolutely love Blender. What a sick ass program!

            <p>
              I reluctantly drew these <b>digital drawings</b> in Procreate. This is a rough translation for, <i>"I bought my wife an iPad and now I feel financially obligated to use it every once in awhile, even though I hate drawing."</i> I also drew the fun Newgrounds-esque frame and other assets that you see on the website.

            <p>
              I have created and played <b>music</b> of all sorts for nearly two decades. I am currently in a couple bands: I play all the instruments for my own projects, I drum in my best friend's noise punk band, and I often moonlight as a fill-in bassist/drummer/guitarist/whatever around my hometown. I don't necessarily play or write in one style; I like to switch it up every so often when my budget and time allow it. I also produce electronic music occasionally.

            <h2><a href="https://goldstarfanclub.net">GOLD STAR</a></h2>
            <p>
              My most recent (personal) music project is called, <b>GOLD STAR</b>. The link above will take you to our website, which is actually the first site I ever coded myself and finished! I like to describe this project as some variation of "twangy, gay, Y2K fuzz rock." The project takes a lot of influence from American proto-punk, Afrobeat guitar instrumentals, '60s country, and '90s alternative rock. My first EP dropped in October 2023, but I plan to record some heavier, sludgier stuff soon! Our live act is definitely a lot fuzzier and loud than our recordings. :)
