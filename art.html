              <b>I love making art.</b> I think it's really important for us, as humans, to create art even if we don't perceive it as "good" or technically impressive. I mean, c'mon, we've been doodling on rocks for millenia. Why wouldn't you want to perpetuate the ultimate human tradition?

            <h4><a href="art_gif_collage.html">HTML Collages</a></h4>
            <p>
              I like to make <b>webpage collages</b> using almost-pure HTML. I only use absolute positioning and very little in-line styling. I code them in VSCodium and get the static images and .gifs from my personal archives. These are definitely my favorite thing to make.

            <h4><a href="art_collage.html">Analog & Digital Collages</a></h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy making <b>digital & analog collages</b> using images mostly from my wife and I's collection of vintage magazines, whose topics vary widely. Most of our collection is '60s/'70s Playboys as well as late '90s-00s video game publications.

            <b>"Esoteric Old Web Art"</b> that I've made using no modern software or tools. No Photoshop, no gimmicky bullshit. I scour for old games, shareware, and the like that allow you to create and save artwork from within them. Aesthetically, think "Kidpix on psychedelics" with a few caveats.

          <h4><a href="art_3d.html">3D Modeling</a></h4>
          <p>
            Making <b>3D models and scenes</b> is a relatively new hobby for me. I haven't done too many projects because they are extremely time consuming and make my office hot, but I absolutely love Blender. What a sick ass program!

          <h4><a href="art_digidraw">Digital Drawing</a></h4>
          <p>
            I reluctantly drew these <b>digital drawings</b> in Procreate. This is a rough translation for, <i>"I bought my wife an iPad and now I feel financially obligated to use it every once in awhile, even though I hate drawing."</i> I also drew the fun Newgrounds-esque frame and other assets that you see on the website.

          <p>
            I have created and played <b>music</b> of all sorts for nearly two decades. I am currently in a couple bands: I play guitar and song for my own project which is a twangy fuzz pop band, I drum in my best friend's noise punk band, and I often moonlight as a fill-in bassist/drummer/guitarist/whatever. I don't necessarily play or write in one style; I like to switch it up every so often when my budget and time allow it. I also produce electronic music occasionally.
