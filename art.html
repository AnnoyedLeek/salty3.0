            I love making art. I think it's really important for us, as humans, to create art even if we don't perceive it as "good." I mean, c'mon, we've been doodling on rocks for millenia. Why wouldn't you want to perpetuate the ultimate human tradition?

            Anyway, you will find a list below detailing the various mediums I utilize to get out the silly ideas in my head. Click any of them to be taken to their respective gallery.

            <h4><a href="art_gif_collage.html">HTML Collages</a></h4>
            <p>
              I like to make webpage collages with pure HTML. I only use absolute positioning and NO CSS except to set the background color and margins. I code them in VSCodium and get the images/.gifs from my personal archives. These are definitely my favorite thing to make.

            <h4><a href="art_collage.html">Analog & Digital Collage</a></h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy making both digital analog collages using images mostly from my wife and I's collection of vintage magazines, whose topics vary widely. Most of our collection is '60s/'70s Playboys as well as late '90s-00s video game publications.

            <p>
              "Art" I've made using no modern software or tools. No Photoshop, no gimmicky bullshit. I scour for old games, shareware, and the like that allow you to create and save artwork from within them. Think "Kidpix on psychedelics" with a few caveats.

              A newer medium for me. I haven't done too many projects because they are extremely time consuming and make my office hot, but I absolutely love Blender. What a sick ass program!

            <p>
              I have made and played music of all sorts for nearly two decades. I am currently in a couple bands: I play guitar and song for my own project which is a twangy fuzz pop band, I drum in my best friend's noisy punk band, and I often moonlight as a fill-in bassist/drummer/guitarist/whatever. I don't necessarily play or write in one style; I like to switch it up every so often when my budget and time allow it. I also produce electronic music occasionally.
