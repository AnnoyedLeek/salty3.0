              I had a few weeks between jobs in the summer of 2022 and spent that time learning how to use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> with no previous experience. I used a really wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9qW8ivJ4Q&t=2s">video series</a> from <b>CrossMind Studios</b>. I really think the best thing you can do to learn 3D modeling quickly is to learn the most efficient controls and hotkeys within the software, which is what the beginning of this series really emphasizes. I would highly recommend this over the usual donut or "low-poly room" tutorial; those are fun to blaze through but I don't think they emphasize the importance of learning Blender's hotkeys, all of which have saved me countless hours of guessing which esoteric menu holds a specific function.

              I haven't made too many creations that I have completely finished, but the <b>first real project</b> that I actually finished in my first few weeks of using Blender is below. I wanted to make a cool 2K resolution wallpaper for my desktop, so I loosely followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Wfl4pyZe0">Polygon Runway tutorial</a> for creating a fantasy-style portal to another dimension, and I really like how it turned out.
