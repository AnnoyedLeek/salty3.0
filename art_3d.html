                I had a few weeks between jobs in the summer of 2022 and spent that time learning how to use <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> with no previous experience. I used a really wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At9qW8ivJ4Q&t=2s">video series</a> from <b>CrossMind Studios</b>. I would <b>highly recommend</b> this series over the usual donut or "low-poly room" tutorial; those might have a fancier end-product, but I don't think those types of tutorials emphasize the importance of learning Blender's hotkeys, all of which have saved me countless hours of guessing which esoteric menu holds a specific function.
                <br><br>
                I only actually <i>learned</i> about Blender for a month or two (off and on), so I hope if you are on the fence about at least learning the basics, that you decide to give it a go! I haven't really touched it much sense that initial ADHD hyperfocus moment, but I know I'll learn more and complete bigger projects someday!

                3D modeling is <b>extremely</b> time-consuming, so I don't have a lot of projects to show off that I have completely finished, but the first one I truly finished in my first few weeks of using Blender is below. I wanted to make a cool 2K resolution wallpaper for my desktop, so I loosely followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2Wfl4pyZe0">Polygon Runway tutorial</a> for creating a fantasy-style portal to another dimension, and I really like how it turned out.

                This mini-project is my attempt at a cel-shaded object. I cannot recall the tutorial I used, which is not very helpful to you, but I think it looks pretty cool! I tried to render from a few different angles so you get a feel for how the shield's appearance changes based on lighting and position.

                One of my dearest friends asked me to make a 3D-animated version of their record label's logo, so of course I obliged. It's not anything crazy, as I really didn't know how to keyframe animations and just Googled my way through that part, but I think it's pretty cool. I wish I would've made the logo a bit thicker, and I also wish I had learned more about materials/lighting in Blender because this would look so cool chromed-out:
