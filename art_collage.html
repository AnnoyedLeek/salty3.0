              <b>I love making collages;</b> they have been my favorite way to express myself for many years. I have not scanned most of the collages I've made and, unfortunately, the majority of the ones that I made between 2015-2020 were in a portfolio that was lost in the mail and never found. The ones I do have left from that era, as well as my newer works, can be found below.

                Apparently I felt extra angry at capitalism when I made this one. All of the statistics about wealth inequality within the artwork were sourced from the <a href="https://inequality.org">Institute for Policy Studies</a>, the United States Census, Forbes, and the Pew Research Center.

                This is a collage that I made by scanning a bunch of ~1960s ephemera lying around my house onto my computer and stitching it together using Photoshop, then I slapped an old picture of me on top of it all. I made it to accompany my <a href="https://goldstarfanclub.net">current musical project's</a> first EP.

                I made this collage by making photocopies of some images from a 1960s Playboy magazine and this really cool, old "Woman of the Year" button we found at a thrift store. I also used a few stamps and miscellaneous scraps of paper in my wife and I's craft pile. I just love women!

                This is a digital collage I made to accompany a deep house song I made a couple years ago.

                I made this collage using a shitty black & white copier and some masking tape at one of my old jobs. I made a bunch of copies and gave them to all of my friends. It's simple but one of my favorites. Who doesn't love the gay cowboy aesthetic?

                This is a quick collage I threw together at a local art museum's creative space. They had a bunch of prints of various artworks in the museum that you could cut up and glue onto a notecard. The woman with the fish has always been one of my favorite paintings at this particular museum, so I was really excited that it was one of the options.

                I made this <i>(extremely uplifting)</i> collage during a workshop that my girlfriend and I attended. The artist who ran the workshop, <a href="https://linktr.ee/stayclosetay">Tay Butler</a>, is an incredibly talented artist. I would highly recommend checking out his works, especially his video collages.

                This is my favorite collage that I've ever made. It's pretty big <i>(3 letter-sized pages taped together)</i> and is an "interpret it how you would like" statement on the church and lesbianism. I cut all the images out of old magazines from the '50s and '60s.

                I recently found this in one of my old work notepads. I don't like to go too insane with every collage that I make, so I like that this one is cartoony and more "fun" than some of my other ones.

                I made this one pretty early on in college when I started to become a bit more radicalized. I remember using my game manual from GTA: San Andreas and a Seventeen magazine for the pictures in this one. Also fuck Steve Jobs.

                I made this collage after I broke up with my first (and only) boyfriend. I thought I was pretty sly using the ripped up Mac Demarco j-card for this one. I, of course, angrily ripped it up for some reason during the course of our relationship. Thank god I'm a lesbian, but this is pretty funny in hindsight.

                I've always loved mid-century design AND women, so this is a perfect early culmination of those interests. Cool colors too! I'm pretty sure I ripped these from a Reader's Digest or something along those lines.

                I think this is the first collage that I ever finished. I made it as a present for my mom's birthday because she loves Wes Anderson and whimsical shit in general. I think she still has the physical copy stashed away somewhere.
