              <b>I love making collages;</b> they have been my favorite way to express myself for many years. I have not scanned most of the collages I've made and, unfortunately, the majority of the ones that I made between 2015-2020 were in a portfolio that was lost in the mail and never found. The ones I do have left from that era, as well as my newer works, can be found below.
