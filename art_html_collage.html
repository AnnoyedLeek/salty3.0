              <b>This is my newest form of art</b>, and I have completely fallen into obsession over it. I make these collages in their own web page using pure HTML, "retro" .gifs that I've harvested from old web archives. I really think these look so cool. I have been spending the past few months perfecting these, and I am currently working on one that (I think) is the best art piece I have ever created. I hope to have it finished sometime soon.

              Eventually, you'll be able to see the actual .HTML page and accompanying code for each collage. For now, I have just made .gifs out of the web pages. I'd love to hear feedback on these, as I am extremely proud of them! <b>Click any of the titles</b> to view the collage at full resolution in a new tab.
