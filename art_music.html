              Below is a handful of tracks that I've written, recorded, and produced. Some of the songs aren't properly mixed or mastered, but oh well. I'm more of an idea guy anyways! 😉 I am self-taught in Ableton, but I didn't learn to properly produce/record my own music until a few years ago, so a lot of my old songs are lost to time and only exist on old, dead hard drives.
