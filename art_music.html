              I am very lucky to have been born to a musician parent, so I have been playing various instruments since I was 6 or 7. I am self-taught at everything I've learned, and my favorite instruments to play are the guitar and drums. I didn't learn to properly record or care about my own music until a few years ago, so a lot of my old songs are lost to time and only exist on old, dead hard drives.

              I mostly record twangy garage rock type songs, some spaghetti western-type stuff, as well as a lot of electronic music: mostly jungle, IDM, and house tracks. I have also been in a few bands including: <a href="https://spiritgoth.bandcamp.com/album/tennis-club">a surf pop band</a>, a cowboy Grateful Dead-ish jam band (no content on the Internet, sorry), a sad country/rock band, and my own fuzz pop outfit.
