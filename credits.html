                On this page, you'll find a somewhat-comprehensive list of the resources that I utilize to develop this website. I have tried to categorize them in a way that makes sense. Let me know if any of the links are ever broken and I will get those fixed. This page is <b>under construction</b>, as I have a lot more resources than this, but I haven't quite gotten around to compiling them all. Check back later for more!

            <h3 class="flex-pad">ü©ª Fonts</h3>
            <p>
              ‚ñ∏ The bitmap font used in the site headings and buttons is called <b>04b_03b</b> and may be downloaded from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/04b-03b.font">dafont.com</a>. The author is Yuji Oshimoto, whose <a href="http://www.04.jp.org/">portfolio</a> is incredibly iconic and worth digging through. This font and its lookalikes were all over forum signatures back in the 2000s!
              <br><br>
              ‚ñ∏ The font that you are reading is called <b>SH Pinscher Regular</b>. Tinghao Hu authored this incredible font; you may download it from their <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/users/sayshu/">1001Fonts</a> profile. My site would honestly be boring and ugly without this font. It is just so well done and easy to read at small point sizes, which is definitely not the case for TRUE bitmap fonts (especially the one above). It even has some emojis built in! üôÇ

            <h3 class="flex-pad">üñºÔ∏è Images</h3>
            <p>
              ‚ñ∏ I obtain most of the <b>animated .gifs</b> on the site from <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>, which is a filename-based .gif search engine provided by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. You can scroll this bad boy for hours and never run out of unhinged images to harvest from other (usually long-dead) personal websites. I recommend clicking the images in the search results; if you do, then you'll be taken to an archival snapshot of the site where it found the image. It's also a fun scroll to share with friends!
              <br><br>
              ‚ñ∏ I assembled the <b>cute floating doll</b> of myself that you see on the site's landing page in a dress-up game from <a href="https://meiker.io/user/diffrances/10048/games">Diffrances</a>. The game is hosted on <b>Meiker.io</b>, which is a fantastic dollmaker website made by Ola Rogula, the original creator of the most OG of all doll sites: <a href="https://www.dolldivine.com/">Doll Divine</a>. üò≤

            <p>
              ‚ñ∏ I utilize the free version of <a href="https://www.cbox.ws/">Cbox</a> for the <b>chatroom</b> that is embedded into Salty's Lair. The free version is nice, but I wish it'd let you change the CSS without paying for the service. I might switch away from this eventually.
              <br><br>
              ‚ñ∏ The goofy animated <b>Surf Club</b> embeddable next to the chatbox will take you to the Surf Club webring navigator (if you click the outer<b>"Warp Zone"</b> ring) to see other member sites in the <a href="https://melonland.net/surf-club">Melonland Surf Club</a>. If you get bored of Salty's Lair, I would definitely check this out!
              <br><br>
              ‚ñ∏ I use <b>Status.Cafe</b> to embed my most recent update (that you see at the bottom-left portion of the site) from my <a href="https://status.cafe/users/saltedslug">site profile</a>.

              <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/">Cloud Convert</a> üî∏ <b>Font File Conversion</b>
              <br>
              I use this site to convert .TTF and .OTF files to web-compatible .WOFF and .WOFF2 files. I try not to use these gimmicky conversion websites when I can avoid it, but sometimes it's worth saving the headache of doing it yourself.

              <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> üî∏ <b>Code Testing & Sharing</b>
              <br>
              I occasionally use CodePen for testing out development ideas without breaking my projects. This "social media-slash-web-development" site allows you to edit and preview HTML, CSS, and JS all in one window (and in real time), but with the added benefit that it doesn't make your eyes bleed. It's also a good way to find new CSS tricks and inspiration from other users!
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="https://emojicopy.com/">EmojiCopy</a> üî∏ <b>Copying Emoticons to the Clipboard</b>
              <br>
              I use this to copy-paste the emoticons you see all over my website into my code editor. I use this site over the many "emoji selector" copycats because they have a search engine that is actually functional, which saves me a lot of time. Yes, modern emojis aren't very 2000s but I love them and they're so fun! Plus, they look cool with my glowy, scanline overlay.</i>

              <br>
              If I could only choose one "indie webdev" tool, it would be Ezgif. This is the holy grail of image conversion and optimization web tools. It translates between common image file types. It crops, compresses, rotates, resizes, and optimizes .gifs. You can even MAKE a .gif out of a stack of pictures, which is not the most straightforward thing to do offline if you don't have a good handle on Photoshop/GIMP. It isn't updated too frequently, but it already has a ton of features that work REALLY well. What more can you ask for out of a free tool? 
            </p>

            <p>
              <a href="https://fsymbols.com/">Fsymbols</a> üî∏ <b>Copying Glyphs/Symbols to the Clipboard</b>
              <br>
              This serves a similar to EmojiCopy, but I use this one for ALT code symbols and other non-emoji symbols. They also provide an "emoji copy" feature but navigating it gives me a headache. You'll see what I mean.

            <p>
              <a href="https://www.remove.bg/">Remove.bg</a> üî∏ <b>Image Background Removal</b>
              <br>
              This site just removes plain backgrounds from an image. I have no idea what they do with my data, and I probably don't want to know, but that's the trade-off I suppose. It works pretty well, so I use it (sparingly) when I am away from home and can't use GIMP or Photoshop.  I wouldn't recommend feeding your personal photos it, however. :)
            </p>

              <a href="https://gifrun.com/">GifRun</a> üî∏ <b>Convert Youtube Clips to .gifs</b>
              <br>
              Downloading a Youtube video, editing it, and converting it into a .gif is a pain in the ass and a big time suck no matter which way you look at it. If you survived the Tumblr fandom wars of '14, then you have probably cried over the .gif creation process. This site takes whatever Youtube URL you feed into it and gives you a simple tool to convert it into a .gif, albeit with a hideous and slightly confusing UI. I've tried a couple of similar online services but they were much more limited with their freemium features.

            <p>
              I work in IT, so I usually cut my teeth on new software and languages by reading the boring vendor documentation and one supplementary "fun" source. My apologies in advance to all my video tutorial watchers, but that stuff doesn't work for me most of the time! I learned all I know through the following sites and the occasional "Stack Overflow" search: 
            </p>
            <br>
            üìÑ <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">MDN Docs</a>
            <p>
              The Mozilla Developer Network documentation is THE webdev [insert religious text of choice here]. They are on the cutting edge of standards and their documentation is beautifully-written and concise. If you can make it through the technical reading, there is no better way to figure out the proper way to code a webpage. 
            </p>
            <br>
            üéì <a href="https://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>
            <p>
              This is the go-to website for most budding front-end developers from what I have gathered. Their tutorials are easy to navigate and understand, and they're taught in a pretty effective order. I think they're a bit behind on coding best practices, especially with some of their CSS methods, but the functionality is definitely there even if not always the most efficient way to do something.
