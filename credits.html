              On this page, you'll find a somewhat-comprehensive list of the resources that I utilize to develop this website. I have tried to categorize them in a way that makes sense. Let me know if any of the links are ever broken and I will get those fixed. This page is <b>under construction</b>, as I have a lot more resources than this, but I haven't quite gotten around to compiling them all. Check back later for more!

            <b>~</b> The bitmap font that I used for headings and buttons is called <b>04b_03b</b> and may be downloaded from <a href="https://www.dafont.com/04b-03b.font">dafont.com</a>. The author is Yuji Oshimoto, whose <a href="http://www.04.jp.org/">portfolio SITE</a> is incredibly iconic and worth digging through. This font and its lookalikes were all over forum signatures back in the 2000s!

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>~</b> The font that you are reading is called <b>SH Pinscher Regular</b>. 
            Tinghao Hu authored this incredible font; you may download it from the artist's <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/users/sayshu/">1001Fonts profile</a>. My site would honestly be ugly with any font but this one. It is just so well done and easy to read at small point sizes. It has some emojis built in, too! üôÇ

            <b>~</b> I obtain most of the <b>animated .gifs</b> on the site from <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>, which is a filename-based .gif search engine provided by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>. You can scroll this bad boy for hours and never run out of unhinged images to harvest from other (usually long-dead) personal websites. I recommend clicking the images in the search results; if you do, then you'll be taken to an archival snapshot of the site where it found the image. It's also a fun scroll to share with friends!
            <br><br>
            <b>~</b> I assembled the <b>cute floating doll</b> of myself that you see on the site's landing page in a dress-up game from <a href="https://meiker.io/user/diffrances/10048/games">Diffrances</a>. The game is hosted on Meiker.io, which is a fantastic dollmaker website made by Ola Rogula, the original creator of the most OG of all doll sites: <a href="https://www.dolldivine.com/">Doll Divine</a>. üò≤

        <h4>Font Conversion</h4>
        <div class="justify-text flex-pad">
          <p>
            I use <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/">Cloud Convert</a> to convert .TTF and .OTF files to web-compatible .WOFF and .WOFF2 files when not included in the font package. I try not to use these gimmicky conversion websites when I can avoid it, but sometimes it's worth saving the headache of doing it yourself.

        <h4>Code Testing & Sharing</h4>
        <div class="justify-text flex-pad">
          <p>
            I use <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> occasionally for <b>testing out development ideas</b> without breaking my projects. This "social media-slash-web-development" site allows you to edit and preview HTML, CSS, and JS all in one window (and in real time), but with the added benefit that it doesn't make your eyes bleed.

        <h4>Copying Emojis</h4>
        <div class="justify-text flex-pad">
          <p>
            <a href="https://emojicopy.com/">EmojiCopy</a> is exactly what it sounds like. I use this to copy-paste the emoticons you see all over my website into my code editor. I use this site over the million other "emoji selector" copycats because they have a search engine that is actually functional, which saves me a lot of time. Yes, modern emojis aren't very 2000s but I love them and they're so fun! Plus, they look cool with my glowy, scanline overlay.</i>

          <p>
            If I could only choose one "indie webdev" tool, it would be <a href="https://ezgif.com/">Ezgif</a>. Ezgif is the <b>holy grail</b> of image conversion and optimization web tools. It translates between common image file types. It crops, compresses, rotates, resizes, and optimizes .gifs. You can even MAKE a .gif out of a stack of pictures, which is not the most straightforward thing to do offline if you don't have a good handle on Photoshop or GIMP. It isn't updated too frequently, but it already has a ton of features that work REALLY well. What more can you ask for out of a free tool?
