            <p>
                I have been collecting .gifs from the Internet for many years, but my passion and collection increased tenfold once I discovered <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a> and the countless graphics sites that have been archived over the last couple of decades. <b>Leeknet</b> is a massive work-in-progress and labor of love. I have tens of thousands of .gifs that I have been actively sorting and organizing for many months. At my last measure, the complete collection sits around ~50,000, but only ~10% are on the site currently.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>FYI</b> - A very small handful of these .gifs contain explicit content, so viewer be warned. Avoid the "LADIES" category if you'd like to steer clear.
