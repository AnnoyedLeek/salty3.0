            <p>
              I am nearly-embarrassed by the sheer volume of .gifs I have on various hard drives, computers, and servers... at my last measure, it sits around ~50,000. I have spent some time over the past few months organizing and sorting them, and I am still working through so many more. This is my archive where I am uploading them!
