              I have been collecting .gifs from the Internet for many years, but my passion and collection increased tenfold once I discovered <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a> and the countless graphics sites that have been archived over the last couple of decades. <b>Leeknet</b> is a massive work-in-progress and labor of love. I have tens of thousands of .gifs that I have been actively sorting and organizing for many months. At my last measure, the complete collection sits around ~50,000, but only ~10% are on the site currently.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <b>FYI</b> - A very small handful of these .gifs contain explicit content, so viewer be warned!
              <br><br>
              <b>PRO TIP:</b> Hold CTRL on your keyboard while clicking any of the .gif files to open them in a new tab.
              <br><br>
              If you are wanting to harvest a whole folder, I would recommend using curl or a download manager like Xtreme Download Manager or Internet Download Manager.

                    <li>Integrated <b>Leeknet</b> into my main website, <a href="https://saltedslug.net">saltedslug.net</a>.</li>
                    <li>Setup a fancy Apache AUTOINDEX theming system I found on Github called <a href="https://github.com/jmlemetayer/abba">ABBA</a> on the web server so all the dynamic HTML pages look nice. :) Thanks to the code author for this bangin' system! I especially love that it generates ABBA lyrics on page errors. </li>
