            Welcome all to my web lair! I'm Salty (F/20-ish/USA) and I use she/her pronouns.
            <br><br>
            I initially started this website in late 2022 to create a space for my art, interests, and hobbies after removing myself from the social media hellscape. I also just wanted to make some online friends after a long hiatus from forums and communal spaces on the Web. Making this website and becoming a part of the "indie web" is one of the best decisions I have ever made.  Over the past year, designing websites has morphed into one of my biggest passions.  My sites and art are influenced by an amalgamation of my favorite media and art but, above all, I am inspired by what webmasters all over the world are creating!
            <br><br>
            I have all sorts of stuff going on here, so have a click around the new and improved interface; there are secret things hidden here and there. I hope you like what you find. If you want to know more about myself and my interests, head over to the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page. Additionally, while I have grown my coding skills immensely since creating my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109052856/https://saltedslug.net/">initial site layout</a>, there is always work to be done. Please contact me if you find any weird issues with my code, have site suggestions, or just want to chat. My contact links are available on my about page.
            <br><br>
            Happy scrolling and don't forget to sign the <a href="https://saltedslug.123guestbook.com/#">guestbook</a> so I can check out your site. :)
