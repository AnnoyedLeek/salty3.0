            Welcome all to my web lair! I'm Salty (F/20-ish/USA) and I use she/her pronouns.
            <br><br>
            I initially started this site in late 2022 to create a space for my art, interests, and hobbies after a self-exile from the social media hellscape. When I discovered Neocities, I fell in love with coding and ultimately decided I would design the website of my dreams circa ~2006. I drew and designed most of what you see here to make that dream a reality; hop over to the <a href="credits.html">site credits</a> page to see the resources I used to do it. Aside from the media of my childhood, this site is inspired by the webmasters who are a part of this "renaissance" of DIY, anti-corporate web design. Much of this new "indie web" feels just like the old days of the Internet where nearly every site had character and was filled with content that was inventive and exciting. I know my younger self would be so proud of the little space I have created here to share with you.
            <br><br>
            I have all sorts of stuff going on up in the navbar! There are secret things hidden here and there, so feel free to let your pointer wander... I hope you like what you find.  If you want to know more about myself and my interests, head over to the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page. Please contact me if you find any weird issues with my code, have site suggestions, or just want to chat. My contact information is also available on my about page.
            <br><br>
            Happy scrolling and don't forget to sign the <a href="https://saltedslug.123guestbook.com/#">guestbook</a> so I can check out your site. :)

            Today I introduced my new site layout, "Salty 3.0." This change is best experienced with your eyes, as my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109052856/https://saltedslug.net/">previous layout</a> looked completely different. The nav has been rearranged, pages have been consolidated and added, and I've poured so much love into the site.
