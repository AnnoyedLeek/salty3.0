              WELCOME ALL to my virtual lair! My name is SALTY (F/20-ish/USA) and I use SHE/HER pronouns.
              <br><br>
              I initially started this site in late 2022 to create a space for my art, interests, and hobbies after my self-exile from social media. After I discovered <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">NEOCITIES</a>, I immediately fell in love with coding and felt destined to design the website of my dreams using only HTML and CSS. I have spent many hours constructing the current version of SALTY'S LAIR; hop over to the <a href="credits.html">CREDITS</a> page to browse the resources I used to create it. Much of the site is inspired by others like it: personal, unique, and built by webmasters who share disdain for the modern web and the tech giants that control it. This sort of "personal website renaissance" that we are sharing now feels much (to me) like early days of the Web where so many sites had character and were filled with content that was inventive and exciting!
              <br><br>
              I have all sorts of stuff going on in the navigation bar above. There are secret things hidden here and there, so feel free to let your pointer wander... I hope you like what you find. If you want to know more about myself and my interests then head over to the <a href="/about.html">ABOUT</a> page. Please contact me if you find any weird issues with my code, have suggestions, or just want to chat. :) My contact information is also available on my about page.
              <br><br>
              Happy scrolling and don't forget to sign the <a href="https://saltedslug.123guestbook.com/#">GUESTBOOK</a> so I can check out your feedback and/or personal sites!

              ‚ú® Today I introduced my new site layout, "Salty 3.0." This change is best experienced with your eyes, as my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109052856/https://saltedslug.net/">PREVIOUS LAYOUT</a> looked completely different. I also restructured the site map and navigation, consolidated and added .html pages, and poured a whole lot more love into a total revision of the site's code and features.
