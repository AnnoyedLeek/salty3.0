            WELCOME ALL TO MY WEB LAIR! I'm SALTY <i>(F/20-ish/USA)</i> and I use SHE/HER pronouns.
            <br><br>
            I initially started this site in late 2022 to create a space for my art, interests, and hobbies after a self-exile from the social media hellscape. After I discovered <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">NEOCITIES</a>, I immediately fell in love with coding and  decided I wanted to design the website of my dreams circa ~2006 using only HTML and CSS. I coded and illustrated most of what you see here to make that dream a reality; hop over to the <a href="credits.html">CREDITS</a> page to browse a list of my external resources. Much of this site is inspired by others like it: personal, built by likeminded webmasters that share disdain for the modern corporate Internet. This sort of "personal website renaissance" feels much like earlier days of the Internet where so many websites had character and were filled with content that was inventive and exciting. I know my younger self would be so proud of the little space I have created here to share with you.
            <br><br>
            I have all sorts of stuff going on in the navigation bar above. There are secret things hidden here and there, so feel free to let your pointer wander... I hope you like what you find. If you want to know more about myself and my interests then head over to the <a href="/about.html">ABOUT</a> page. Please contact me if you find any weird issues with my code, have suggestions, or just want to chat. :) My contact information is also available on my about page.
            <br><br>
            Happy scrolling and don't forget to sign the <a href="https://saltedslug.123guestbook.com/#">GUESTBOOK</a> so I can check out your feedback and/or personal site!

            Today I introduced my new site layout, "Salty 3.0." This change is best experienced with your eyes, as my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109052856/https://saltedslug.net/">previous layout</a> looked completely different. The nav has been rearranged, pages have been consolidated and added, and I've poured so much love into the site.
