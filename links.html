            Welcome to my <b>link farm</b>! This is an ever-growing page full of my favorite websites and free software that I find myself coming back to. I try to pick the best ones, so there isn't any "filler" on here that will only keep a few minutes of your attention. I've given brief descriptions of each link so you know what you're clicking on.

            <br>
            <p>
              This is a list of <b>active archives of old Geocities</b> pages and other "Old Web" staples that served similar functions. If you aren't aware of what Geocities is then congratulations, you still have your youth! To learn more, checking out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Wiki page</a> is a good place to start. I also like this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230618173508/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/remembering-geocities-the-suburbia-of-the-early-web">article</a> that delves into the site's overall ethos. It's been weird to witness how much the Internet has changed over the past 20 years. Even though places like Geocities definitely had many problems and shortcomings, I really miss this stuff.
              <br><br>
              <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> <i>Like most Internet archives that have popped up over the years, these sites are often unstable and contain a lot of broken images and links, as well as expired SSL certificates. They also tend to completely disappear after a few years due to rising hosting costs and a slew of other variables. I'm not trying to be an old IT guy shaking his fist at the sky; I've just seen a lot of websites I truly love die quickly and often without warning.</i>

            📌 <a href="http://www.oocities.org/#gsc.tab=0">OoCities.org</a>
            <p>
              I have been uneasily waiting for OoCities to die for some time. They've been going since 2009, which is a dinosaur extinction amount of time to stay online in Internet years. They saved as many Geocities sites as they possibly could before Yahoo shut it down, so there is a ton of content here. However, this site is on its last leg, so it's pretty damn slow and doesn't currently have a valid security certificate. If you have the patience, though, I think it's worth the slow scroll.

            📌 <a href="https://www.fortunecity.ws/">FortuneCity.ws</a>
            <p>
              This is a slowly dying archive of old FortuneCity sites. FortuneCity was a webhosting service oriented toward personal pages similar to Geocities, although it was not as popular. It was more of a front to promote Warner Brothers content more than anything, but there is still some cool stuff to be found here!

            📌 <a href="https://geocities.restorativland.org/">Geocities Gallery by Restorativland</a>
            <p>
              This is visuals-focused Geocities archive. Their archived sites tend to be complete and mostly free of broken links and assets, which is hard to find these days. The archive hasn't been updated since 2019, so again, it is only a matter of time before they stop paying the hosting costs. Save what you can!

              This is a list of <b>queer-oriented links</b>. Not sure what all I will put here yet, but expect most links to be related to WLW stuff due to my chronic lesbianism.

            📌 <a href="http://www.strangesisters.com/">Strange Sisters</a>
            <p>
              This is a really cool archive of mid-century lesbian pulp novel book covers. There are different themes you can browse through, or you can just go A-Z. They also have a companion website for the gays called, <a href="http://gayontherange.com/" class="small-link">"Gay on the Range."</a>

            <p>
              Brian Foo is an absolute genius, and his body of work within the field of computer science is astounding. The Data-Driven DJ is my favorite project of his; he describes it as, <i>"...a series of music experiments that combine data, algorithms, and borrowed sounds."</i> If you like this one, he also has a ton of amazing (often interactive) projects listed on his <a href="https://brianfoo.com/" class="small-link">website</a>.
