                👋 <b>Welcome all</b> to my virtual lair! My name is <b>Salty</b> (F/26/USA) and I use <b>she/her</b> pronouns.
                <br><br>
                When I discovered <a href="https://neocities.org" target="_blank">Neocities</a> a few years ago, I felt destined to create the homepage of my dreams that expressed my personality and interests. In late 2022, I started learning to code in HTML and CSS. I have since spent countless hours constructing the version of <b>Salty's Lair</b> that sits before you; hop over to the <a href="credits.html">Site Credits</a> page to browse the resources I used to create it. Much of the site is inspired by others like it: personal, unique, and built by webmasters who share disdain for the modern web and the tech giants that control it. This sort of "homepage renaissance" that we are sharing feels much (to me) like early days of the Web where so many sites had character and were filled with content that was inventive and exciting!
                <br><br>
                I have all sorts of stuff going on here at the lair. Use the <b>navigation bar</b> above to travel around; any words you see in <b style="color: var(--slugblue);">blue</b> are clickable links. There are secret things hidden here and there, so feel free to let your pointer wander... I hope you like what you find. If you want to know more about me, you should head over to the <a href="/about.html">about</a> page; my contact information is available on that page as well. Please contact me if you find any weird issues with my code, have suggestions, or just want to chat!
                <br><br>
                Happy scrolling and don't forget to sign the <a href="https://saltedslug.123guestbook.com/#">guestbook</a>. ✍️

              💯 Thanks to the help of <a href="https://melonking.net">Melon</a> and his wonderful <a href="https://forum.melonking.net/index.php?topic=115">JavaScript trickery</a>, the browser tab and URL update appropriately to which page of the website you click on! There is hope for the future yet. <b><3</b> This is, hopefully, the extent of JS that will ever be implemented on the site.
