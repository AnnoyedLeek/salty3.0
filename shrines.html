            More web shrines are coming soon, I swear... but here are some of my works-in-progress and other ideas for shrine topics:
            <ul>
              <li>🕺 ABBA -- only <i>the</i> greatest pop band of all time, homies.</li>
              <li>⛓️ ALICE IN CHAINS -- only <i>the</i> greatest band of the grunge era.</li>
              <li>💻 THE ALMIGHTY COMPUTER <i>(and its related peripherals)</i></li>
              <li>⚡ FALLOUT 1, 2, & TACTICS using sprites and tiles I've ripped from the old game files.</li>
              <li>🎭 THE SIMS 1 using archives of the Maxis site and rips from the game assets. </li>
              <li>🏹 MAMAMEDIA - This was an early-Internet <i>(mid '90s-early '00s)</i> "edutainment" site that I absolutely loved when I was a kid.</li>
              <li>💀 SPOOKY SHRINE - At this point, I feel like it's a Neocities rite of passage to have a spooky shrine filled with Halloween .gifs. </li>
              <li>🛹 A VIRTUAL SKATEPARK with cool old skate posters and ads, as well as all my collection of skateboarding .gifs. There are a lot! </li>
              <li>🛡️ A MEDIEVAL BATTLEFIELD <i>(a la 'Age of Empires')</i> full of knight .gifs bonking the shit out of each other with swords or whatever. </li>
              <li>⚔️ An ode to the culture and visual look of RUNESCAPE during the mid 2000s. Yes, I'm old and no, I do not own a party hat. </li>
              <li>🍃 MS. MARY JANE - This one might already be hidden on the site somewhere... >:-) </li>
              <li>👭 A shrine to LESBIAN-CODED characters in pop culture and modern media. </li>
              <li>🎸 A shrine to my FAVORITE MUSICIANS OF THE 1960s using design sensibilities from those eras.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
