            More shrines are coming soon, I swear... in the meantime, here are some works-in-progress and topic ideas:
            <ul>
              <li>🪩 <b>Abba</b> -- only <i>the</i> greatest pop band of all time, homies.</li>
              <li>⛓️ <b>Alice in Chains</b> -- only <i>the</i> best band of the grunge era.</li>
              <li>💻 <b>The Almighty Computer</b> <i>(and its related peripherals)</i> - Self-explanatory-ish.</li>
              <li>⚡  <b>Fallout 1, 2, & Tactics</b> using sprites and tiles I've ripped from the old game files.</li>
              <li>🎭 <b>The Sims (OG)</b> using archives of the Maxis site and rips from the game assets. </li>
              <li>🏹 <b>Mamamedia</b> - This was an early-Internet <i>(mid '90s-early '00s)</i> "edutainment" site that I absolutely loved when I was a little kid.</li>
              <li>💀 <b>Spooktacular Shrine</b> - At this point, I feel like it's a Neocities rite of passage to have a spooky shrine filled with Halloween .gifs. </li>
              <li>🛹 <b>A virtual skatepark</b> with cool old skate posters and ads, as well as all my collection of skateboarding .gifs. There are a lot! </li>
              <li>🛡️ <b>A medieval battlefield</b> <i>(a la 'Age of Empires')</i> full of knight .gifs bonking the shit out of each other with swords or whatever. </li>
              <li>⚔️ <b>Runescape</b> - An ode to the culture and visual look present during Runescape's golden era in the early-to-mid 2000s. Yes, I'm old and no, I do not own a party hat. </li>
              <li>🍃 <b>Ms. Mary Jane</b> - This one might already be hidden on the site somewhere... <i>Hint: the link is hidden on every page in the same place.</i> </li>
              <li>👭 <b>Lesbians in pop culture</b> - A shrine to lesbian-coded characters in pop culture and modern media. </li>
              <li>🎸 <b>1960s Musicians</b> - A shrine to my favorite '60s musicians with a page design that uses/emulates accurate aesthetics from the era.</li>
            </ul>
