                This is the landing page for all the <b>technomancer-related</b> things on my website. I am constantly collecting pieces of technology, hoarding old computers, and trying out new (and old) software. I figure the best place to yammer about all of my cool stuff, aside from when I can con my wife into listening to me talk about it, is on my website! This page will eventually hold all the things you see detailed below:

                <br>
                I have a ton of "old" tech that I've been accumulating over the years. My collection includes old cameras, camcorders, computers, TVs, and oddball electronics that I eventually want log in an archive with pictures and write-ups about each item, as well as any cool projects I've done with them.

                In case you missed it, I'm a big fan of computers. Naturally, I have been slowly perfecting my PC setup for many years with a suite of custom scripts, software, and other software debauchery. Learn about all that stuff and maybe also someday play with the stickers and magnets on a virtual copy of my computer case! :)

              I have always loved collecting physical media, especially <b>the almighty CD-ROM</b>. It's nice to actually <i>own</i> software and music in an era plagued with streaming services and digital licenses. I especially like to swipe up mystery CDs from thrift stores that contain shareware, clip art graphics collections, or retro PC games. This link will take you to my Internet Archive profile where you may download anything from my collection!

                <br>
                As a kid, I loved harvesting extra content like icon sets and desktop wallpapers from old PC games, promotional websites, and DVD-ROMs. Luckily, I've always been pretty responsible with my digital data, so most of that stuff has been carried over to every new computer I've had since I was 8 or 9. I will upload these to the site someday.

                I would love to collect all my goofy avatars from my experiences in online gaming over the last 20 years. You know: Neopets, Runescape, AdventureQuest, that sort of thing. Many of the sites I used are long dead, but you never know what I may find on an old flash drive someday!
