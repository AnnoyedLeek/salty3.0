This is a pretty comprehensive list of the software that I use on my Windows PCs for my various hobbies. I find it's much easier to find functional, reliable software in a Linux environment, but I (unfortunately) require Windows for a lot of things, so I hope this list helps if you're looking for a similar setup on big boy Microsoft's tantrum-prone OS.

Additionally, https://alternativeto.net/ is your best friend if you're looking for a wide-range of user-aggregated software alternatives. You can use all sorts of filters like price point (or open source), operating system, and a few other data points. There is also a pretty solid review system where developers are able to respond. AlternativeTo is awesome, seriously; they aren't paying me to say this.

Anyways, on to the list. For reference, my main workstation is running Windows 11 (version 23H2 or greater) via Intel processing. I do not run WSL on my system <i>yet</i>. :) I am also running an .ISO of Win11 that I modded, so it's missing a lot of telemetry and invasive features, which is why I require a lot of alternatives to things like Photo Viewer, WordPad (R.I.P.), and other MS store apps.

    Who doesn't love Igor Pavlov's gift to the world? It's free, it's open source, and it's lightyears faster than Windows' built-in utility.
