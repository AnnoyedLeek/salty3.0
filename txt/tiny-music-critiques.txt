I love to qualify songs into a category that I call, "20 year-old white kid's "Grindset" workout." Today's contribution is "AIN'T GONNA ANSWER" [https://youtu.be/T4uydrotIEw?si=sViPkJaZmGKyQaxc] by NLE Choppa with a Lil Wayne feature. I just KNOW the 20-something meatheads at my local gym (who are probably gaslit into thinking working 80 hours per week is normal) listen to this song on repeat when they're trying to deadlift an unreasonable amount of weight for their #fitstagram accounts. No shade to NLE though, this song goes hard even if it's kinda goofy. And honestly, Lil Wayne's voice annoys the f*ck out of me, but his verse on this song is one of his best in recent years.

I don't get the '60s/'70s trend of fading songs out on an extended chorus. I think it's a total cop out. For example, Eddie Rabbitt's trucker anthem, "Drivin' My Life Away."

It could've ended the last chorus with a twangy, fuzzed-out riff and would've been way more memorable. This is one of my favorite eras of music, but
