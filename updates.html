Also tweaked HTML a little bit to help with mobile responsiveness. There's still a lot of work to be done on Salty's Lair re: responsive design and accessibility. I am actively working on it, I promise!

I also optimized all images on the site using <a href="https://ezgif.com">ezgif</a>, so the landing page should load <b>much faster</b> than before. Finally, I added a small section of CSS to make the site look better on <b>hi-res gamer edition screens</b> (greater than 1080p). Enjoy. :)

              <p>
                ‚ú® Today I introduced my new site layout, <b>Slug 3.0</b>. This change is best experienced with your eyes, as my previous layout looked completely different. I also restructured the site map and navigation, consolidated and added .html pages, and poured a whole lot more love into a total revision of the site's code and features. There are still a few pages from the original site that I haven't migrated yet, but keep an eye out in the coming days for more updates!

                Another tiny update as I near the third revision of my website! I've been working very hard on a total site overhaul (both visually and its code) for awhile now, and I hope to have it done within the coming months. I have been busy with a new job and recording music, but I did finally make an <b>88x31 button</b> for my site. You'll find it on the <a href="misc.html">Miscellanea</a> page. :) Enjoy and see you soon!

                I have been working hard on what feels like a million different projects. I've made a few more websites since updating this one, and I have also been busy making new music and art. However... I have found the time to completely remake the site from scratch! <b>Salty Slug 2.0</b> is far more responsive and well-written code-wise, and I am very pleased with how it has evolved. I hope you guys like it. :)
